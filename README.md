# CULI Scoring

This research is the development of the Chulalongkorn University students’ speaking tests scoring system, following CEFR rubrics. We partner with CULI (Chulalongkorn University Language Institute) to obtain the students’ speaking dataset. The final product is expected to process the students’ speaking audio and output the CEFR score along with the text feedback in each rubric.
